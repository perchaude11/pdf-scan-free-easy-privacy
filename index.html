      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-12-28</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how PDF Scan Free &amp; Easy ("the app")
        handles information when you use it.
      </p>

      <h2>What the app does</h2>
      <p>
        The app lets you capture or import images, apply enhancements, and export
        them as PDF files. Processing happens on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Information the app handles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera access to capture documents (only when you choose to scan).</li>
        <li>Photos and files you select for scanning (processed locally).</li>
        <li>Generated PDF files saved to your device at your request.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        The app displays ads through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect or receive
        information such as device identifiers, IP address, approximate location,
        and ad interaction data to provide and measure ads. This data is handled
        by Google according to their policies.

        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>Data sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. Data related to advertising is
        processed by Google AdMob as described above.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not maintain a user account or store your scanned documents
        on a server. Files remain on your device unless you delete them.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date above
        reflects the latest version.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the
        developer contact listed on the Google Play Store listing for the app.
